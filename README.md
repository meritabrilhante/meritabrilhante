### How you doing? 👋

I'm a backend developer based in Brasilia.

I started my carrer working as Product Designer/Frontend developer, graduated in Graphic Design until I realize that my truly passion it really was backend.

So now, I work for almost 2 years with software engineering for web applications and 1 year formally as backend developer.

- 🔭 I’m currently working as Back End Developer at @Basement.io
- 🌱 I’m always studying about architecture, design and code patterns.
- 🧠 Because of my history as Designer I have a lot knowledge and interest in Design Systems and UI Design.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm crazy about aviation and probaly I would love to work with embedded systems.
